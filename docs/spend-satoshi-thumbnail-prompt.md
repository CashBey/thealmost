# Thumbnail prompt — Spend Satoshi’s Bitcoin (odd fun style)

Square composition (1:1), minimalist experimental web thumbnail, neal.fun inspired but original.
Clean near-white background with soft vignette.
A large rounded pill-shaped card representing a “balance”, no text, no icons.
A subtle warm-tinted circular “coin” element near the lower-right, slightly blurred.
Very soft shadows, gentle depth, calm tension.
No characters, no logos, no words, no symbols.
Modern UI design, quiet unsettling mood, neutral contrast, works on dark backgrounds too.
