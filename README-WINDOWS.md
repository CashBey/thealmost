# odd fun (corrected structure)

## Run (Windows)
1) Open Terminal / PowerShell in THIS folder (where package.json is):
   - You should see: app/, public/, package.json

2) Install deps:
   npm install

3) Start dev server:
   npm run dev

Open: http://localhost:3000

## Important
- Do NOT run `npm run dev` inside `public/`.
- `app/` must be at the project root (same level as package.json).
- `public/` is only for static files (images, thumbnails, favicon, etc).
